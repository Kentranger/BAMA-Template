Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document provides some general advices and requirements which should
 be regarded writing a bachelor, master or diploma thesis with a clear focus
 on computer science -- especially implementating or programming -- related
 topics.
 The here mentioned structures, advices and hints are recommendations and
 do not have to be followed word by word in a dogmatic interpretation.
 Each thesis has special aspects making it maybe necessary to differ in
 minor or major parts from this template.
 Nevertheless all formulated advices of this template shall help you writing
 a well structured as well as understandable bachelor, master or diploma
 thesis.
 So if you plan to break out of the general structure of this template think
 first about your reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
General writing advices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do not forget to write your thesis in parallel to your software modeling,
 programming and testing activities.
 Thesis which are written after the complete modeling, programming and testing
 activities are often hardly readable and understandable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be aware of the following points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With ongoing progress you are becoming more and more an expert within your
 thesis domain.
 Nevertheless your surrounding does not run through your very individual
 learning pogress.
 So it is very likely at some point that you assume knowledge from your
 reader which you rate as basic knowledge.
 Think back if you had this knowledge before you start your thesis.
 If not - it is very likely that this knowledge could be hardly assumed
 basic knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You should write your thesis for someone who has no detail knowledge about
 your thesis domain.
 Do not write your thesis for your supervisor.
 You should write it for someone who might want to continue your work (maybe
 another student of the following semester) and needs your knowledge and
 experience but starts to get into touch with your work from a low experience
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Your target audience may be computer scientists but it is likely that they
 do not have detail knowledge about your thesis domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Especially your second supervisor might be no domain expert.
 Keep him oder her in mind when writing.
 But be aware it is very likely that you first get to know your second superviso
r after you have finished writing your thesis.
 This is challenging but also very disciplining for writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remember that you write a technical documentation.
 So your style of writing should reflect this.
 Try to write in a formal and professional style you know from e.g.
 software or other technical manuals.
 If unsure you should try to copy this style of manual writing (do not copy
 the texts).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Never write sentences like: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I analysed requirements by applying use case modeling techniques.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Write instead: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Requirements were analysed by applying use case modeling techniques.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So AVOID 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in your paragraphs.
 You are not writing a diary!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Use word processors which are common in science
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Use-word-processors"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical word processors like MS Word or Open Office are not made for long
 texts with a lot of references, footnotes, tables, figures, etc.
 So sometimes you get into trouble if your texts are getting longer and
 longer as well as your referencing gets more and more complicated.
 This can be very frustrating especially in your last finalizing steps of
 your thesis.
 Nevertheless this is typical for technical documentation and it is typical
 for a thesis document as well.
 So you should think about more professional word processors like LaTeX
 which are very common in the technical and science domain.
 These tools provide the following features which will make your every day
 live of thesis writing a lot simpler:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable image and table handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable list handling (list of figures, tables as well as contents)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable cross reference handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable footnote handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable cite and bibliography handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reliable PDF generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are advised to use the following freely available and approved toolset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX is a graphical front end to LaTex.
 With LyX a lot of technical details of the very complex LaTeX toolsuite
 is hidden.
 You can use LyX almost like an Wordprocessor like MS Word or Open Office.
 Nevertheless it provides all detail features of LaTeX if someone needs
 it.
 LyX runs on Linux/UNIX, Windows or Mac based systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LaTeX is a document markup language and document preparation system for
 the TeX typesetting program.
 TeX is a popular means by which to typeset complex mathematical formulae
 or complex technical or academical texts; it has been noted as one of the
 most sophisticated digital typographical systems in the world.
 TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science,
 economics, engineering, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology.
 LaTeX runs on Linux/UNIX, Windows or Mac based systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
BibTeX is a reference management software for formatting lists of references.
 The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation
 system.
 BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner, by separating
 bibliographic information from the presentation of this information, similarly
 to the separation of content and presentation/style supported by LaTeX
 itself.
 BibTex runs on Linux/UNIX, Windows or Mac based systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Like LyX for LaTeX there exist a lot of front ends for BibTeX which help
 you to manage your references beyond a text file basis.
 Most popular BibTeX front end which is supported by Linux/UNIX, Windows
 or Mac systems is JabRef (which is a java implementation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You find all necessary links for the above mentioned toolsuite in the following
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:A-proper-TeX"

\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
How to embed tables and figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables are primarilly used for presenting data in a structured way.
 Nevertheless a table should never exist in a text without a reflecting
 context paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures are primarilly used for presenting data or complex aspects, relations,
 structures, etc.
 in a graphical way.
 A figure should never exist in a text without a reflecting context paragraph
 describing the intent and key information of the figure in words.
 In computer science and software modeling contexts these figures are often
 forms of UML diagrams.
 Nevertheless the here mentioned advices are relevant for all kind of figures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be aware of the following points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Number tables and figures.
 You should use the in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Use-word-processors"

\end_inset

 mentioned word processor table and figure handling features to handle this
 automatically and frictionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Provide lost of tables and figures.
 You should use the in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Use-word-processors"

\end_inset

 mentioned word processor features to handle this automatically and frictionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every embedded table or figure should be reflected and referenced from the
 written and surrounding text.
 You should use the in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Use-word-processors"

\end_inset

 mentioned word processor table and image embedding and referencing features
 to handle this automatically and frictionless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You should embed every table and figure in the same style (e.g.
 all tables and figures left-, right-adjusted or all centered, font-style
 and font-sizes in all tables the same, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are two examples how to embed and reference tables and figures within
 a text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table

Literature Research and Requirements Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within this chapter you should reflect your task description and formulate
 key aspects in order to derive necessary requirements which are vital for
 the ongoing guidance of your software modeling and implementation steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases it might be usefull to seperate literature research and requiremen
ts analysis in two distinct chapters.
 This might be an appropriate strategy for a literature research intensive
 thesis.
 For most bachelor or diploma thesis with a clear software implementation
 focus the provided template structure might be sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use special requirements engineering techniques like use cases you
 should explain the key concepts of the technique from a general point of
 view (provide references to your sources) and provide reasons why this
 technique is appropriate for your problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be aware of plagiarism:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You should keep an eye on your references.
