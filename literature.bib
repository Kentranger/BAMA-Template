@conference{Kratzke2011a,
	Abstract = {Although cloud computing is in all mouth today it seems that there exist only little evidences in literature that it is more economical effective than classical data center approaches. Due to a performed qualitative analysis on COBIT, TOGAF and ITIL this paper postulates that cloud-based approaches are likely to provide more benefits than disprofits to IT management. Nevertheless one astonishing issue is the not often stressed ex ante cost intransparency of cloud based approaches which is a major implicit problem for IT investment decisions. This paper shows first considerations how to overcome this issue by providing considerations for a cost estimation model and corresponding architectural, usage and consumption (cost) indicators.},
